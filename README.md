## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to overlay a div/image with a color and icon.

```css
.overlay{
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 99%;
    background: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.474);
    border-radius: .7rem;
    opacity: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

I'd continue learning on overlaying images with colors as I had a hard time proeperly overlaying the image with color.
Also i'd continue learning about centering with flexbox properly.
